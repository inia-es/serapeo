# Serapeo

**Serapeo** is a secondary repository that allows you to extend any public repository, and use your specific metadata instead of - or in addition to - metadata provided by them.

Learn more about this project and its intentions checking our [Open Planvas](meta/open_planvas.pdf)

## Description

When you use a public repository for your organization research results, you have to accept the metadata they provide. **Serapeo** is designed to maintain 
local metadata for your organization research results synced with the public repository you want to use.

It's a solution for small and medium sized organizations that cannot manage their own repository, but don't want to lose fine-grained descriptions of their results, or want to use domain-specific metadata instead of just bibliographic info.

Extendable first is the main concept after **Serapeo**'s design. Plugins for some very popular free and open source repositories will be developed (Zenodo, CKAN, Dataverse, ...) and others will be easy to add by contributors. 

## Quick start
To be done. Come back soon to check when the first alpha version (a prototype maybe) has been released.

## Contributing
**Serapeo** is a work-in-progress in a very preliminar stage. Soon after we release our first alpha or prototype we'll tell you how to participate in the project.

In any case, feel free to contact us if you feel you can help to improve the project in any way.

## Needs
Our first goal is syncing with Zenodo, so we need access to http://sanbox.zenodo.org accounts before we're able to build our Minimum Viable Product.

## Why **Serapeo**?

This project is developed to extend [Zenodo](http://github.com/zenodo/zenodo) what is called after *Zenodotus* the first librarian using metadata in the Great Library of Alexandria. **Serapeo** is called after the *Serapeum* the secondary library of the Great Library of Alexandria, where many items where copied and saved after the great fire.

Furthermore, that *Serapeum* was the temple of *Serapis*, a syncretistic deity of Alexandria, with attributes of Egypcian and Greek deities, designed on purpouse to join people from both cultures in a multi-ethnic city.
